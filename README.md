   B.  MONGO_URI = mongodb+srv://train-system:OHSeWkWwPeToI3Ku@cluster0.0fn8ke9.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0

   C.  JWT_SECRET = Aq6GVG+a+nCQLRq2d0L6o4yj3oP7PeU7Bjzc2WsJU7XLoPP2h4Bbyh7Rrwn/Ml0CLTda/IUFZ5F0DNGu8IDDSUdpQgjjHmvQJAJ6omxOWI2hi2+zvFcl+0Saoz42HQzvaNQ61hXTsxMWf2YfqSDyinqUsYMBPMnvAT3M1xpejbeMmlevIkqHJIjCUs+WKtrO3pELfFLWYM0n+z8/XnJB550azrBD70T7XIhQej4a9ooiTC8+HJpgqDmcd2Dsbj7AR7S9q4g+vXkhXPytQv7M/iHKpy8ED/PgKOE3OX7LjnDsIVIML0drK4pIb33z0YCv6CIq6/iQ6alJVDJ0Mu
